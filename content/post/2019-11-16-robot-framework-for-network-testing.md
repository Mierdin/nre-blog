Using automated testing frameworks help us create test cases that can be used to verify the operations on multiple devices with better code/test coverage, thereby reducing the testing cycle time.

In our lesson [Using Robot Framework for Automated Testing](https://labs.networkreliability.engineering/labs/?lessonId=29&lessonStage=1), we discuss the Robot Framework which is a Python based test automation framework. Robot is extensively used by the mobile, web, and embedded systems industry to perform acceptance testing. It provides a simple interface to write test-cases that can be arranged into a test-suite and is easy to implement. It also provides detailed reports on the Fail/Pass cases for each run in html format, and provides complete visibility to the individual test cases and their outputs.

This tutorial consists of three stages, and aims to teach the basics of Robot framework, how we can write test cases to verify the operation of Junos devices, and some best practices that can be adopted while writing test cases in Robot. The lesson also gives the students a hands-on lab experience facilitated by the NRE-Labs, where they can execute and verify the test cases on their own in a virtual environment.

Checkout our lesson on the NRE-Labs - [Using Robot Framework for Automated Testing](https://labs.networkreliability.engineering/labs/?lessonId=29&lessonStage=1), and have fun automating!
