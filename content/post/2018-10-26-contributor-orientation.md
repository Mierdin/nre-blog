I wrote a quick runthrough of some of the orientation sessions we'll be running in the first weeks of NRE Labs:

> Every Friday, we’ll be conducting introductory training for new contributors. We’ll be covering things like how to build a dev environment, the release cadence, how to design new lessons and much more. If you’d like to attend, just send a direct message to @NRELabs or send a message on the #nre_labs Slack channel. We’ll send an invite for the weekly Google Hangout.  In the coming months, we’ll also have recorded training sessions on YouTube.
