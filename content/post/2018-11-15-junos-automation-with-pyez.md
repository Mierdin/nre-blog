NRE Labs is a free and easily accessible virtual lab environment for network engineers to learn some fundamental automation concepts likes JSON, YAML and APIs. The NRE Labs is welcome for contributors to develop lessons around various domains including Troubleshooting, Verification, and Configuration.

I am happy to contribute a lesson “Junos Automation with PyEZ” to share how to use PyEZ for network automation and managing Junos devices in a programmable way.

The NRE labs PyEZ lesson covers most common network management tasks. You do not have to be an experienced programmer to use PyEZ. What you need is just basic Python knowledge, and the lesson will show you how to use the interactive Python shell to connect to a vQFX switch, perform operational tasks, retrieve running status, and apply configuration changes for Junos devices easily.

PyEZ is the fundamental building block of Junos automation. Many common Python based automation tools (e.g. Ansible, Salt, JSNAPy) are using PyEZ under the hood to interact with Junos devices.  In addition, starting from Junos release 16.1, it added the support of Python language for on-box automation scripts, you can use PyEZ in your op/event/commit script to manage the device locally.

Come and join the [PyEZ lesson](/labs/?lessonId=16&lessonStage=1) now to get started with learning the new way to manage your network infrastructure!
