# NRE Blog

The [NRE Site](https://networkreliability.engineering) is powered by static pages, generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

To write a blog, check out the existing blogs in the [post directory](https://github.com/nre-learning/nre-blog/tree/master/content/post). You can open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to this repository to add a markdown file with your own blog post, and we'll consider including it in the site.
